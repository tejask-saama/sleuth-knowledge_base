### **Summary of Findings**

- **Intra-table Relationships**: Each table has unique identifiers that ensure data integrity and uniqueness. For example, brokers, adjusters, locations, and insurance companies all have unique IDs that link to their respective attributes.
  
- **Inter-table Relationships**: The relationships between tables are primarily based on foreign keys. For instance, the `PLC` table links to the `INS` and `BRKR` tables, indicating that each policy is associated with one insurance company and one broker. The `CLM` table links back to the `PLC` table, showing that claims are tied to specific policies.

- **Table-level Relationships**: The `PLC` table serves as a central hub connecting various aspects of the insurance process, including coverages, surcharges, fees, discounts, and claims. This structure allows for comprehensive tracking and management of insurance policies and their associated elements.

This structured analysis provides a clear understanding of how the data elements within the database are interconnected, facilitating better data management and analysis strategies.
